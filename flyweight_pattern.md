# Flyweight Pattern in Java

## **What is the Flyweight Pattern?**
The **Flyweight Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that focuses on reducing memory usage by sharing common parts of objects. Instead of creating multiple instances of similar objects, it allows sharing of intrinsic state (data that doesnâ€™t change between objects), while externalizing unique data as extrinsic state.

---

## **Why Use the Flyweight Pattern?**

1. **Memory Optimization**: 
   - Reduces the number of objects in memory by reusing shared data.
   - Particularly useful in systems where many objects share common properties.

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Avoids frequent creation of new objects, reducing CPU and memory overhead.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Helps manage a large number of similar objects effectively.

4. **Real-World Examples**:
   - Applications with repetitive objects like GUI components, text editors, or large-scale systems like a ride-sharing app where vehicle details can be shared.

---

## **How It Works**

The Flyweight Pattern separates object data into:
- **Intrinsic State**: Shared data that is constant across many objects (e.g., vehicle type, color, capacity in a ride-sharing app).
- **Extrinsic State**: Unique data that varies across instances and is passed dynamically (e.g., current location and destination).

### **Key Components**
1. **Flyweight Interface**: Defines methods for objects with shared data.
2. **Concrete Flyweight**: Stores intrinsic state and provides methods to handle extrinsic data.
3. **Flyweight Factory**: Manages the creation and reuse of flyweight objects, ensuring that identical intrinsic states are shared.
4. **Client**: Uses flyweight objects and provides extrinsic data.

## **Example: Ride-Sharing Project**

### **Scenario**
In a ride-sharing app, vehicles have attributes like `type`, `color`, and `capacity` (intrinsic). Each ride has unique details like `current location` and `destination` (extrinsic). The Flyweight Pattern optimizes the system by reusing vehicle objects with the same intrinsic properties.

---

### **Step 1: Flyweight Interface**
```java
interface Vehicle {
    void assignRide(String currentLocation, String destination); // Handles extrinsic data
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Concrete Flyweight**
```java
class VehicleFlyweight implements Vehicle {
    private final String vehicleType; // Intrinsic state
    private final String color;       // Intrinsic state
    private final int capacity;       // Intrinsic state

    public VehicleFlyweight(String vehicleType, String color, int capacity) {
        this.vehicleType = vehicleType;
        this.color = color;
        this.capacity = capacity;
    }

    @Override
    public void assignRide(String currentLocation, String destination) {
        System.out.println("Ride Assigned -> Type: " + vehicleType + ", Color: " + color +
                ", Capacity: " + capacity + ", Location: " + currentLocation + ", Destination: " + destination);
    }
}
```

---

### **Step 3: Flyweight Factory**
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class VehicleFactory {
    private final Map<String, Vehicle> flyweights = new HashMap<>();

    public Vehicle getVehicle(String vehicleType, String color, int capacity) {
        String key = vehicleType + ":" + color + ":" + capacity;

        if (!flyweights.containsKey(key)) {
            flyweights.put(key, new VehicleFlyweight(vehicleType, color, capacity));
            System.out.println("Creating new vehicle flyweight for: " + key);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Reusing existing flyweight for: " + key);
        }

        return flyweights.get(key);
    }
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Client Code**
```java
public class RideSharingFlyweightDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VehicleFactory factory = new VehicleFactory();

        // Assign rides using shared flyweights
        Vehicle car1 = factory.getVehicle("Car", "Red", 4);
        car1.assignRide("Downtown", "Airport");

        Vehicle car2 = factory.getVehicle("Car", "Red", 4);
        car2.assignRide("Mall", "University");

        Vehicle bike1 = factory.getVehicle("Bike", "Black", 2);
        bike1.assignRide("Station", "Park");

        Vehicle car3 = factory.getVehicle("Car", "Blue", 4);
        car3.assignRide("Hotel", "Convention Center");

        // Check memory reuse
        System.out.println("Are car1 and car2 the same object? " + (car1 == car2));
        System.out.println("Are car1 and car3 the same object? " + (car1 == car3));
    }
}
```

---

### **Explanation**
1. **Intrinsic State**:
   - `vehicleType`, `color`, and `capacity` are shared between objects.
2. **Extrinsic State**:
   - Ride-specific details like `currentLocation` and `destination` are passed at runtime.
3. **Flyweight Factory**:
   - Ensures that vehicles with the same intrinsic properties are reused.
4. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Instead of creating separate objects for every ride, intrinsic states are reused.

### **Output**
```
Creating new vehicle flyweight for: Car:Red:4
Ride Assigned -> Type: Car, Color: Red, Capacity: 4, Location: Downtown, Destination: Airport
Reusing existing flyweight for: Car:Red:4
Ride Assigned -> Type: Car, Color: Red, Capacity: 4, Location: Mall, Destination: University
Creating new vehicle flyweight for: Bike:Black:2
Ride Assigned -> Type: Bike, Color: Black, Capacity: 2, Location: Station, Destination: Park
Creating new vehicle flyweight for: Car:Blue:4
Ride Assigned -> Type: Car, Color: Blue, Capacity: 4, Location: Hotel, Destination: Convention Center
Are car1 and car2 the same object? true
Are car1 and car3 the same object? false
```

## **Advantages in Ride-Sharing**
1. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Optimizes memory usage when handling a large fleet of vehicles with similar properties.
2. **Reusability**:
   - Vehicles with identical intrinsic properties are reused, reducing redundancy.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Enables the application to scale efficiently as the number of rides increases.
